# Hash Tables
A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values, though there are some hash functions that support variable length output.[1] The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, digests, or simply hashes. The values are usually used to index a fixed-size table called a hash table. Use of a hash function to index a hash table is called hashing or scatter storage addressing.
