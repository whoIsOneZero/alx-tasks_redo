1. String Concatenation (+): You can concatenate strings using the +
operator. For example:

str1 = "Hello"
str2 = "World"
result = str1 + ", " + str2
print(result)  # Output: "Hello, World"

2. String Formatting (str.format() or f-strings): You can use string formatting to insert values into a string template. This is especially useful for creating formatted strings with placeholders:

name = "Alice"
age = 30
formatted_str = "My name is {} and I am {} years old.".format(name, age)
print(formatted_str)  # Output: "My name is Alice and I am 30 years old."

Alternatively, you can use f-strings (as you did in your original script) for string formatting:
name = "Alice"
age = 30
formatted_str = f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old."
print(formatted_str)  # Output: "My name is Alice and I am 30 years old."

3. Joining Strings with .join(): You can use the .join() method to concatenate a list of strings with a delimiter:

words = ["Hello", "world", "!"]
combined_str = " ".join(words)
print(combined_str)  # Output: "Hello world !

4. String Repetition with str * n: As you initially used, you can use the * operator to repeat a string n times:

text = "Repeat me "
repeated_text = text * 3
print(repeated_text)  # Output: "Repeat me Repeat me Repeat me "
